# Cybersecurity & Cryptography Lab

# Overview

Welcome to the Cybersecurity & Cryptography Lab! This lab is designed to help you explore various aspects of cybersecurity and cryptography through practical exercises.

# The lab is divided into three parts:

    * Password Hashing: Implement password hashing into a signup/login page using bcryptjs.
    * Ciphers: Create your own cipher and code it out.
    * Cybersecurity Research: Research a major cybersecurity breach over the past 20 years and write a short response.

# Part 1 - Password Hashing

In this part, you will implement password hashing functionality into a signup/login page. Follow the instructions provided in the lab materials to integrate bcryptjs and build out the register and login functions.

# Part 2 - Ciphers

For this part, you will create your own cipher. Define the logic behind your cipher, encipher the phrase "I love cryptography!", and then decipher the ciphered phrase. Afterwards, code your cipher in your preferred programming language.

# Part 3 - Cybersecurity Research

Research a major cybersecurity breach that occurred over the past 20 years. Write a short essay covering the overview of the breach, motivations behind it, tech flaws exploited by hackers, and the company's response to protect against similar vulnerabilities.
